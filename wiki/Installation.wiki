#summary Requirements and procedure.

== Introduction ==
SocialConnect is available as a Django application installable in any Django project.

SocialConnect uses models so you need to create the table with a "syncdb" command. The application comes with fixtures for Facebook, MySpace and Partuza support.

To be able to communicate with the API of an external platform, SocialConnect needs an API key and secret. They are usually delivered by the platform, so you have to create a application on the developer wepage of the platform.

SocialConnect also requires several external libraries:

 * pyFacebook (revision 173)
