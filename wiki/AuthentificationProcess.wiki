#summary The authentification with Facebook and OAuth.

= Introduction =

Any call to Facebook or OpenSocial REST API require an authentification. SocialContext does not follow the password anti-pattern but the custom Facebook login process and OAuth.


For Facebook, the user is redirected to http://www.facebook.com/login.php where it must sign in and accept the Facebook application of the platform before coming back to the platform.

For OpenSocial, the authentification is made through [http://oauth.net/ OAuth] as the OpenSocial specifications required. The workflow is roughly the same as with Facebook, the user is redirected to the OpenSocial container where he sign in and accept the OAuth token.
